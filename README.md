Background about this person:
Name: Hussain Marketwala
Age: Around 40 Years
 Hussain Marketwala has been living with his parents and his family of 4 - Wife (Arwa Marketwala and 2 children). His parents are senior citizens aged over 80 years, He has regularly been beating and hurting his old parents and hoping for them to die. 
He and his wife have planned and taken all the assets from his father including gold jewellery and movable immovable property and made them suffer. His neighbours are prroof of the torture that he does on his old parents on a daily basis. #ElderOffencesIndia ; #SeniorCitizenRightsIndia ; #familyviolence #crimestoppers

Infact he had an aunt who used to live with them Ms Nafisa Marketwala. Hussain and his wife had schemed and puhed the old lady such that her leg was broken and she passed away, The root cause of her death was that she was kicked and thrown down by Hussain Markwtwala. #ElderlyAbuseIndia ; #ProtectingEldersIndia
This person has now moved his focus on his parents and is beating them regularly. He has been terrorising his parents and everyone in the family.
Speaking about terror this person Hussain Marketwala was arrested by the Navrangpura police in the year 2007. He had tried to break into Shri Narendrabhai Madi’s convoys but was stopped by the special forces. He somehow managed to lie and come out of the incident with a clean chit because of corruption of some individuals. This incident happened on 29 08 2007 and can be found in the Asian Age newspaper dated 30 08 2007 and also in the Navrangpura police records. 
This person is completely insane, his mind been radicalised and always talks about harming others. He has to be investigated and put on surveillance.
It is a crime and a sin to even deal with such individuals. People like Hussain Marketwala who spread terror are a danger to the society. But marketing platforms don’t investigate the background of the owners and list their companies on their paltforms. Innocent people deal with him and unknowingly become party to the crime.
